    <h1>How the Web Works</h1>
  <p><b>You</b> open your<b> computer </b> to view the internet.<br>
  The <b>internet</b> is a collection of linked documents (mostly html) saved on various servers.<br>
  <b>Servers</b> are large computers used for storage, not for display, like your personal computers.<br> 
  Your <b>browser</b> uses the protocal <b>http</b> to access all the different servers.<br>
  
  </p>
  <p>you > your computer/browser > the internet > http > servers</p>
  <p>you < your computer/browser < the internet < http < servers</p>
<h3>What is a website</h1>
  <p>A bunch of <b>text documents</b> read by <b>browsers</b> which browsers interpret the text into a display.</p>
<h3>What coding looks like</h1>
  <p><b>inline vs block</b></p>
    <p>block - invisibile boxes separating<br>
    < p >, < div >, < form >
    </p>
      
    <p>inline - in the line of text <br>
    < span >, < br >, < em >
    </p>
  <p><b>normal vs void</b></p>
    <p>normal has opening and closing <br>
    < p > < / p > 
    </p>
    <p>void has only one set <br>
    < img src = "" >
      
    </p>
<h3>Computers are stupid/literal</h1>
  <p>They can't figure out what you meant, only what exact code they know.<br>
  So small typos or mistakes can become big problems.</p>
<h3>You can't remember everything</h1>

<h3>HTML vocab</h1>
  <p>tag = < > </p>
  <p>element = < element > < /element ></p>
  <p>attribute = < a <span>href</span> = "" ></p>
